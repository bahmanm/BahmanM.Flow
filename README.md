# Flow: Clean, Composable Business Logic for .NET

* ‚ùå Is your business logic a tangled, and potentially ugly, mess?
* ‚ùå Are there `try-catch` blocks and `if-else` statements everywhere?
* ‚ùå Do you see side-effects, error handling, logging, retries, and more all over the place?

_Ugh_ üò£

---

* ‚úÖ WHAT IF you could build your workflow as a clean, chainable pipeline of operations instead? 
* ‚úÖ A pipeline that clearly separates the "happy path" from error handling, logging, retries, ...
* ‚úÖ A pipeline that is a pleasure to express, read, and maintain?

_Oh!?_ ü§î

--- 

THAT, my dear reader, is the problem **Flow** solves üôå

* Lightweight
* Fluent API
* To build pipelines that are:
  * Declarative
  * Resilient
  * Composable
  * Easy to test

---

Allow me to demonstrate. Imagine turning this imperative code:

```csharp
public User GetUserAndNotify(int userId)
{
    try
    {
        var user = _database.GetUser(userId);
        _auditor.LogSuccess(user.Id);
        return user;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to get user");
        return GetDefaultUser();
    }
}
```

Into this simple Flow:

```csharp
public Flow<User> GetUserAndNotifyFlow(int userId)
{
    return Flow.Create(() => _database.GetUser(userId))
               .DoOnSuccess(user => _auditor.LogSuccess(user.Id))
               .DoOnFailure(ex => _logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to get user"))
               .Recover(ex => GetDefaultUser());
}
```

_Nice and neat, eh!?_ üëç

---

But...the REAL win is in Flow's **plug-and-play design** üîå
* A Flow is just a **recipe** for your business logic.
* Since it is nothing more than a definition, it can be enriched and reused: cheap and simple.
* You can enhance any Flow with new behaviours without ever touching the original code -- no, seriously üòé

---

Allow me to demonstrate:

1. Say, next sprint, you realise you need retry logic? Easy -- you simply enrich your existing flow!

```csharp
var resilientGetUserFlow = 
    GetUserAndNotifyFlow(httpRequestParams.userId)
      .WithRetry(3);
```

2. Or maybe you want to add a timeout? No problem!

```csharp
var timeoutGetUserFlow = 
    resilientGetUserFlow 
      .WithTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
```

3. Need to log the failure? Just do it!

```csharp
var loggedGetUserFlow = 
    timeoutGetUserFlow
      .DoOnFailure(ex => _logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to get user"));
```

4. I could go on, but you get the idea üòâ

---

In short, with Flow you create components that are:
- Readable
- Predictable
- Reusable
- Easy to test

# Flow in Action: A Real-World Scenario

Let's walk through a realistic example of building and using a Flow.

### Step 1: üèóÔ∏è Building the Core Business Logic

Say, we are the authors of `PaymentCollectionService`: 
* We want to generate and send payment collection notices.
* We've got to call several other services that we do not own.

Here is the complete method from our `PaymentCollectionService`. It defines the entire business process as a series of steps which are composed together.

```csharp
// This method lives in our PaymentCollectionService.
public IFlow<PostalTrackingId> CreateCollectionNoticeFlow(int userId)
{
    // 1Ô∏è‚É£
    return _billingService.GetBillingProfileFlow(userId)

        // 2Ô∏è‚É£
        .Select(profile => new { profile.Fullname, profile.BillingAddress })

        // 3Ô∏è‚É£
        .Chain(data =>
            _templateService.GenerateDocumentFlow(
                "CollectionNotice",
                data.Fullname,
                data.BillingAddress
            )
        )

        // 4Ô∏è‚É£
        .Chain(document => _dispatchService.SendByPostFlow(document));
}
```

Let's break it down line by line:
* **1Ô∏è‚É£:** It all starts by calling the billing service which returns a Flow to get a user's profile.
* **2Ô∏è‚É£:** `.Select()` takes the `profile` and extracts just the `Fullname` and `BillingAddress`.
* **3Ô∏è‚É£ & 4Ô∏è‚É£:** `.Chain()` is like saying "and then...". It links the next steps in the process, where each step can fail.

Our method returns a single, reusable `IFlow<PostalTrackingId>` that encapsulates our entire business process.

### Step 2: ‚ú® The Payoff - Enrichment at the Call-Site

Now, let's switch hats.

We are another team who is a consumer of the `PaymentCollectionService`.

The product requirements for our application demand strong resiliency for this feature.

And guess what!? üëâ We don't need to ask the `PaymentCollectionService` team to add retries or timeouts!

We can apply these policies ourselves üòé

---

First, we get the core Flow from `PaymentCollectionService`:
```csharp
var coreNoticeFlow = _paymentCollectionService.CreateCollectionNoticeFlow(userId: httpRequestParams.userId);
```

The external APIs can be flaky, so let's plug in the required resiliency policies:
```csharp
var resilientNoticeFlow = coreNoticeFlow
    .WithRetry(3)
    .WithTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(45));
```

And if it ultimately fails, we need to create a ticket for manual follow-up:

```csharp
var finalNoticeFlow = resilientNoticeFlow
    .DoOnFailure(ex => _ticketService.CreateManualFollowUpTicket("Collections", ex));
```

---

_We just saw the core principle of Flow in action:_

* _The `PaymentCollectionService` defined the business logic._
* _We, as the consumer, applied the operational logic on top._
* _The two are completely decoupled._

### Step 3: üèÅ Executing the Final, Enriched Flow

We've built our final recipe. We've **declared** our Flow/intention/plan of action. 

But NO actions have been taken yet - NOTHING has been executed.

Time to pass the recipe to the chef!

Enter FlowEngine. 

```csharp
var result = await FlowEngine.ExecuteAsync(finalNoticeFlow);

var message = result switch
{
    Success<PostalTrackingId> s => $"Notice sent! Tracking ID: {s.Value.Id}",
    Failure<PostalTrackingId> => "Failed to send collection notice after all retries.",
};

Console.WriteLine(message);
```

### üí° Bottom Line 

Flow allows you to build clean and focused business logic.

You then compose operational concerns around it **where they're needed, not where they're defined**. üéØ


# Meet the Core Toolkit

Building a Flow is like assembling a team of specialists. Each one has a specific job. Let's meet the main players you'll be working with.

### 1. The Starters: `Flow.Succeed()`, `Flow.Fail()`, `Flow.Create()`

This is your starting point. Every Flow begins here.

*   `Flow.Succeed(value)`: Use this when you already have a value and want to bring it into the `Flow` world.
*   `Flow.Fail(exception)`: Use this to explicitly start a pipeline in a failed state. It's perfect for short-circuiting a workflow after some initial validation fails.
*   `Flow.Create(action)`: Use this when your starting point is a function that might succeed or fail (like a database call or an API request). `Create` wraps that function, capturing its success or failure outcome.

### 2. The Transformer: `.Select()`

`.Select()` is your specialist for transforming the **value** inside a successful Flow.

Think of it like LINQ's `Select`. It takes a function that maps the input value to a new output value (e.g., `Func<TIn, TOut>`). If that function throws an exception during the transformation (for example, a deserialization error), the `Flow` will **automatically catch it** and transition to a `Failure` state.

```csharp
// This function might throw if the request is malformed.
var command = CreateCommandFromRequest(request);

// .Select() will safely handle the potential exception from the transformation.
var commandFlow = Flow.Succeed(request)
    .Select(req => CreateCommandFromRequest(req));
```

### 3. The Sequencer: `.Chain()`

`.Chain()` is your specialist for connecting to the **next Flow**.

You use `.Chain()` when the next step in your process is an action that returns another `Flow`. 

This is the key to building complex pipelines: It takes the result of one step and "chains" it to the next operation, keeping the pipeline **clean and flat** and avoiding nested `Flow<Flow<T>>`.

```csharp
// GetUserFromApiFlow itself returns an IFlow<User>.
// .Chain() ensures the result is a simple IFlow<User>.
var userFlow = userIdFlow.Chain(id => GetUserFromApiFlow(id));
```

### 4. The Safety Net: `.Recover()`

No matter how well you plan, things go wrong. `.Recover()` is your contingency plan.

It attaches to a Flow and specifies what to do if any preceding step fails. 

You can use it to provide a default value, run a backup operation, or gracefully handle an exception.

```csharp
// If the API call fails, return a default user instead of blowing up.
var safeUserFlow = userFlow.Recover(exception => GetDefaultUser());
```

### 5. The Bystander: `.DoOn...()`

Sometimes you just need to *do* something without changing the result. 

This is the job of the `.DoOnSuccess()` and `.DoOnFailure()` family.

Like a bystander on the sidelines, they let you peek inside the `Flow` as it passes by, perform a side-effect (like logging), and then let the original outcome continue on its way, untouched.

```csharp
// Log the user's name on success, or the error on failure.
var observedFlow = userFlow
    .DoOnSuccess(user => _logger.Log($"Got user: {user.Name}"))
    .DoOnFailure(ex => _logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to get user"));
```

---

Now...here‚Äôs a more formal look at the principles behind the design:

# Core Principles

1.  **Immutable Declarations:** All `IFlow<T>` instances are **immutable**. All operators (e.g., `.Chain()`, `.Select()`) do not modify the flow they are called on; they return a **new, decorated `IFlow<T>` instance**. This guarantees that the *declaration* of a flow is reusable and safe to share. The thread safety of the overall *execution* depends on the thread safety of the user-provided delegates.

2.  **Declarative & Lazy:** A `Flow` is a declarative "recipe" for a computation. It defines *what* should happen, not *how* or *when* it should be executed. The entire chain is evaluated lazily by the `FlowEngine`.

3.  **Separation of Concerns:** The declaration of a flow (`IFlow<T>`) is strictly separated from its execution (`FlowEngine`). This allows for a clean, testable, and extensible architecture.

# Key Scenarios & Usage

This section provides client-side code snippets for each major operator, which can serve as a basis for user acceptance tests.

## Core Operations

### 1. Declaring and Executing Flows

```csharp
// A simple synchronous flow
var simpleFlow = Flow.Succeed(42).Select(x => x * 2);
var result = await FlowEngine.ExecuteAsync(simpleFlow);

// A flow with asynchronous operations
var asyncFlow = Flow.Succeed("user-123", new FlowId("user-enrichment"))
    .Chain(userId => GetUserFromDatabaseAsync(userId));
var userResult = await FlowEngine.ExecuteAsync(asyncFlow);
```

### 2. Transformation (`Select`)

```csharp
// Synchronous transformation
var syncSelect = Flow.Succeed("  hello  ").Select(text => text.Trim());

// Asynchronous transformation
var asyncSelect = Flow.Succeed(42)
                      .Select(async userId => await GetUserNameFromDbAsync(userId));
```

### 3. Sequencing (`Chain`)

```csharp
// Chaining a synchronous operation that returns an Outcome
var syncChain = Flow.Succeed(5).Chain(value => Outcome.Success(value + 10));

// Chaining an asynchronous operation that returns a Task<Outcome>
var asyncChain = Flow.Succeed(42)
                     .Chain(async userId => await GetUserDataAsync(userId));
```

### 4. Failure Recovery (`Recover`)

```csharp
// Recovering with a simple fallback value
var simpleRecovery = Flow.Fail<string>(new Exception("...")).Recover("Default Value");

// Recovering with an asynchronous function
var asyncRecovery = Flow.Fail<User>(new Exception("..."))
                        .Recover(async ex => await GetDefaultUserFromCacheAsync(ex));
```

### 5. Performing Side Effects (`DoOnSuccess` / `DoOnFailure`)

```csharp
// Synchronous side effect
var syncTap = Flow.Succeed(42).DoOnSuccess(v => Console.WriteLine(v));

// Asynchronous side effect
var asyncTap = Flow.Succeed("user-123")
                     .DoOnSuccess(async id => await _auditService.LogAccessAsync(id));
```

## Advanced Operations

### 1. Operation-Scoped Resources (`Flow.WithResource`)

```csharp
var resourceFlow = Flow.Succeed("user-123")
    .Chain(userId =>
        Flow.WithResource(
            acquire: () => new HttpClient(),
            use: httpClient => NotifyServiceAsync(httpClient, userId)
        )
    );
```

### 2. Concurrency (`Flow.All` & `Flow.Any`)

```csharp
// Flow.All runs all flows and returns an array of results.
var allFlow = Flow.All(
    GetUserAsync(1),
    GetUserAsync(2)
);

// Flow.Any returns the result of the first flow to complete successfully.
var anyFlow = Flow.Any(
    GetUserFromCacheAsync(1),
    GetUserFromDbAsync(1)
);
```

### 3. Enriching Flows with Behaviours

Behaviours enrich a flow with cross-cutting concerns.

#### 3.1 Timing out an Operation

```csharp
// Simple usage
var simpleTimeoutFlow = CreateLongRunningFlow()
    .WithTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));

// Advanced usage with a policy
// (Note: The specific builder methods and policy properties are illustrative and TBD.)
var policy = new FlowTimeoutPolicy(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
var advancedTimeoutFlow = CreateLongRunningFlow()
    .WithTimeout(policy);
```

#### 3.2 Retrying a Failed Operation

```csharp
// Simple usage
var simpleRetryFlow = CreateSometimesFailingFlow()
    .WithRetry(3);

// Advanced usage with a policy
// (Note: The specific builder methods and policy properties are illustrative and TBD.)
var policy = new FlowRetryPolicy(maxAttempts: 3);
var advancedRetryFlow = CreateSometimesFailingFlow()
    .WithRetry(policy);
```

#### 3.3 Applying Custom Behaviours

The `WithBehaviour` operator allows for the application of custom, stateful behaviours that can alter the control flow.

```csharp
// The user defines a reusable behaviour by implementing the IBehaviour<T> interface.
public class CircuitBreakerBehaviour<T> : IBehaviour<T>
{
    // The behaviour provides its own type for richer diagnostics.
    public string OperationType => "Flow.CircuitBreaker";

    // The Apply method returns a new flow that wraps the original.
    public IFlow<T> Apply(IFlow<T> originalFlow)
    {
        // The implementation would check the circuit breaker's state.
        // If the circuit is open, it would return Flow.Fail(...).
        // Otherwise, it would execute the originalFlow and update the state.
        return Flow.Create(() => {
            // ... state-checking and wrapping logic would go here ...
            return FlowEngine.ExecuteAsync(originalFlow);
        });
    }
}

// The user can then apply this behaviour to any flow.
var circuitState = new CircuitBreakerState();
var resilientFlow = CreateFlakyApiServiceCall()
    .WithBehaviour(new CircuitBreakerBehaviour(circuitState));
```

# Design Rationale

This section documents the key architectural decisions that shape the Flow API, focusing on the "why" behind the design.

### 1. The Core Philosophy: Recipe & Chef

The central architectural pattern is a strict separation of concerns:

*   **`IFlow<T>` is the Recipe:** It is a purely declarative, **immutable** data structure representing the sequence of operations. It is an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that defines *what* to do, not *how* to do it.
*   **`FlowEngine` is the Chef:** It is the interpreter that knows how to execute an `IFlow<T>` AST. It is the single source of execution logic.
*   **Operators are Pure Functions on the Flow:** With the exception of the `Do` family of operators, all extension methods in `FlowExtensions` (e.g., `.Chain()`, `.Select()`, `.Recover()`) are themselves pure functions with respect to the `IFlow<T>` data structure. They take a flow as input and return a **new, decorated `IFlow<T>` instance**, never modifying the original. This guarantees that flow declarations are immutable, reusable, and safe to share.
*   **The `Do` Operators are Transparent:** The `DoOnSuccess` and `DoOnFailure` operators are an exception to the "return new instance" rule. They are designed for pure side effects and are intended to be completely transparent to the flow's structure. Therefore, they should return the **same `IFlow<T>` instance** they were called on, allowing them to be chained without adding a new node to the AST.

This separation ensures the business logic declared in a `Flow` remains pure and testable, while the complexities of execution are handled by the engine.

### 2. `FlowExecutionOptions`: Decoupling Execution from Declaration

All parameters that control a specific execution run (the "how-to-run" instructions) are contained within the `FlowExecutionOptions` object. This includes the `CancellationToken` and the `IFlowExecutionObserver`. This approach keeps the `FlowEngine.ExecuteAsync` signature stable and makes the API extensible, as new execution-time options can be added without breaking changes.

### 3. The Observer Pattern for Diagnostics

To provide visibility into the engine's execution, we chose a decoupled observer pattern over baking diagnostics directly into the engine.

*   **`IFlowExecutionObserver`:** This interface defines a contract for observing the engine's lifecycle. It is designed to be implemented by users to bridge `Flow` events to their chosen diagnostic or logging framework.
*   **Multi-Method Interface:** The interface uses specific, discoverable methods (`OnOperationStarted`, `OnFlowSucceeded`, etc.) with default implementations. This provides the best of both worlds: it's easy for users to implement (they only override what they need), and it's extensible for the library (new methods can be added without breaking existing implementations).
*   **Interface-Based Events:** The events passed to the observer are defined by a hierarchy of interfaces (`IFlowEvent`, `IOperationEvent`, etc.). This allows for flexible, type-safe pattern matching in observer implementations while decoupling the observer from the concrete event implementation classes.

### 4. Extensible Enumerations: The `FlowOperationTypes` Pattern

To identify the type of operation in a diagnostic event, we use a `string` property (`IOperationEvent.OperationType`). To provide compile-time safety for built-in operations, we also provide a `public static class FlowOperationTypes` containing `const string` definitions. This is a standard .NET library pattern that provides the safety of an `enum` for known types and the extensibility of a `string` for user-defined custom operations.

### 5. Strongly-Typed IDs

Instead of using primitive `string` types for flow and operation identifiers, we use dedicated `FlowId` and `OperationId` classes. This is a best practice that:
*   Improves type safety throughout the API.
*   Encapsulates the ID generation logic (`FlowId.Generate()`).
*   Makes the code more self-documenting.

### 6. The `Failure` Model

A `Failure<T>` in the `Outcome<T>` model always contains an `Exception`. This was a deliberate design choice to align with standard .NET idioms. "Business-level" failures (e.g., validation errors) should be modeled as a type of `Success<T>` (e.g., `Success<ValidationResult>`), while the `Failure` path is reserved for true, exceptional circumstances that disrupt the normal flow of a computation.

### 7. Resource Management Patterns

The Flow library provides a single, clear pattern for managing resources.

*   **`Flow.WithResource`:** This factory is used for **isolated, operation-scoped resources**. The mandatory `acquire` function makes it explicit that a new resource is created for the scope of the `use` function. The `where TResource : IDisposable` constraint ensures that the resource is properly disposed of by the engine, mirroring the behavior of a standard C# `using` block. It is the correct tool for encapsulated resources, like an `HttpClient` for a single API call.

*   **Shared Resources (Deferred):** The problem of managing resources that must be shared across multiple, independent operations (e.g., a `DbTransaction`) is a more advanced use case. The exploration of a `FlowEnvironment` (`Reader` monad) pattern to solve this has been deferred to a future work item (`dx006`) to keep the core API lean and focused.

## Œª For Functional Programmers

If you have a background in functional programming, you may recognize some familiar patterns in `Flow`. This section provides a brief mapping from `Flow` concepts to their traditional FP counterparts.

*   **`IFlow<T>` as a Monad:** At its core, `Flow` is a monad for managing asynchronous, failable operations. It encapsulates a value and a context (in this case, the potential for failure and the sequence of operations).

*   **`Outcome<T>` as `Either<Exception, T>`:** The `Outcome<T>` type, which is the result of executing a `Flow`, is a classic sum type representing one of two possible outcomes. It is directly analogous to the `Either` monad, where `Success<T>` corresponds to `Right<T>` and `Failure<T>` corresponds to `Left<Exception>`.

*   **`Flow.Succeed()` as `return` or `pure`:** This is the monadic unit function. It takes a simple value and lifts it into the monadic context (`Flow`).

*   **`.Chain()` as `bind` or `flatMap`:** This is the quintessential monadic binding function (`>>=`). It takes a value from a monadic context, applies a function that returns a new monad (`A -> M<B>`), and flattens the result (`M<B>`). This is the foundation of sequencing in `Flow`.

*   **`.Select()` as `map` or `fmap`:** This is the functorial `map`. It allows you to apply a pure function (`A -> B`) to the value inside the monadic context without affecting the context itself. Flow's implementation also includes exception handling, automatically lifting a thrown exception into a `Failure` state.

*   **`FlowEngine` as the Interpreter:** The `FlowEngine` acts as the interpreter that "runs" the monadic computation. It traverses the constructed `Flow` (which is essentially an Abstract Syntax Tree) and executes the described effects, ultimately producing an `Outcome<T>`.

This separation of declaration (`IFlow`) from execution (`FlowEngine`) is a deliberate choice to make the monadic nature of the library an implementation detail rather than a prerequisite for users.

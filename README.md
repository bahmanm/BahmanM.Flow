# ![Flow Log](docs/imgs/flow-256x256.png) Flow: Clean, Composable Business Logic for .NET

-  ‚ùå Is your business logic a tangled, and potentially ugly, mess?
-  ‚ùå Are there `try-catch` blocks and `if-else` statements everywhere?
-  ‚ùå Do you see side effects, error handling, logging, retries, and more all over the place?

_Ugh_ üò£

---

-  ‚úÖ WHAT IF you could build your workflow as a clean, chainable pipeline of operations instead? 
-  ‚úÖ A pipeline which clearly separates the "happy path" from error handling, logging, retries, ...
-  ‚úÖ A pipeline which is a pleasure to express, read, and maintain?

_Oh!?_ ü§î

--- 

THAT, my fellow engineer, is the problem **Flow** solves ![Flow Log](docs/imgs/flow-32x32.png)

-  Lightweight 
-  Fluent API 
-  To build pipelines that are:
   -  Declarative
   -  Resilient
   -  Composable
   -  Easy to test

---

Allow me to demonstrate. Imagine turning this imperative code:

```csharp
public User GetUserAndNotify(int userId)
{
    try
    {
        var user = _database.GetUser(userId);
        _auditor.LogSuccess(user.Id);
        return user;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to get user");
        return GetDefaultUser();
    }
}
```

Into this Flow:

```csharp
public Flow<User> GetUserAndNotifyFlow(int userId)
{
    return Flow.Create(() => _database.GetUser(userId))
               .DoOnSuccess(user => _auditor.LogSuccess(user.Id))
               .DoOnFailure(ex => _logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to get user"))
               .Recover(ex => GetDefaultUser());
}
```

_Nice and neat, eh!?_ üëç

---

But...the REAL win is in Flow's **plug-and-play design** üîå
-  A Flow is just a **recipe** for your business logic.
-  Since it is nothing more than a definition, it can be enriched and reused: cheap and simple.
-  You can enhance any Flow with new behaviours without ever touching the original code - no, seriously üòé

---

Allow me to demonstrate:

1. Say, next sprint, you realise you need a retry logic? Easy - you simply enrich your existing flow!

```csharp
var resilientGetUserFlow = 
    GetUserAndNotifyFlow(httpRequestParams.userId)
      .WithRetry(3);
```

2. Or maybe you want to add a timeout? No problem!

```csharp
var timeoutGetUserFlow = 
    resilientGetUserFlow 
      .WithTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
```

3. Need to log the failure? Just do it!

```csharp
var loggedGetUserFlow = 
    timeoutGetUserFlow
      .DoOnFailure(ex => _logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to get user"));
```

4. I could go on, but you get the idea üòâ

---

In short, with Flow you create components that are:
-  Readable
-  Predictable
-  Reusable
-  Easy to test

# ‚öôÔ∏è Flow in Action: A Real-World Scenario

Let's walk through a realistic example of building and using a Flow.

### Step 1: Building the Core Business Logic

Say, we are the authors of `PaymentCollectionService`: 
-  We want to generate and send payment collection notices.
-  We've got to call several other services that we do not own.

Here is the complete method from our `PaymentCollectionService`. It defines the entire business process as a series of steps which are composed together.

```csharp
// This method lives in our PaymentCollectionService.
public IFlow<PostalTrackingId> CreateCollectionNoticeFlow(int userId)
{
    // 1Ô∏è‚É£
    return _billingService.GetBillingProfileFlow(userId)

        // 2Ô∏è‚É£
        .Select(profile => new { profile.Fullname, profile.BillingAddress })

        // 3Ô∏è‚É£
        .Chain(data =>
            _templateService.GenerateDocumentFlow(
                "CollectionNotice",
                data.Fullname,
                data.BillingAddress
            )
        )

        // 4Ô∏è‚É£
        .Chain(document => _dispatchService.SendByPostFlow(document));
}
```

Let's break it down line by line:
-  1Ô∏è‚É£: It all starts by calling the billing service which returns a Flow to get a user's profile.
-  2Ô∏è‚É£: `.Select()` takes the `profile` and extracts just the `Fullname` and `BillingAddress`.
-  3Ô∏è‚É£ & 4Ô∏è‚É£: `.Chain()` is like saying 'and then...'. It links the next steps in the process, where each step can fail.

Our method returns a single, reusable `IFlow<PostalTrackingId>` that encapsulates our entire business process.

### Step 2: The Payoff - Enrichment at the Call-Site

Now, let's switch hats.

We are another team who is a consumer of the `PaymentCollectionService`.

The product requirements for our application demand strong resiliency for this feature.

And guess what!? üëâ We don't need to ask the `PaymentCollectionService` team to add retries or timeouts!

We can apply these policies ourselves üòé

---

First, we get the core Flow from `PaymentCollectionService`:
```csharp
var coreNoticeFlow = _paymentCollectionService.CreateCollectionNoticeFlow(userId: httpRequestParams.userId);
```

The external APIs can be flaky, so let's plug in the required resiliency policies:
```csharp
var resilientNoticeFlow = coreNoticeFlow
    .WithRetry(3)
    .WithTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(45));
```

And if it ultimately fails, we need to create a ticket for manual follow-up:

```csharp
var finalNoticeFlow = resilientNoticeFlow
    .DoOnFailure(ex => _ticketService.CreateManualFollowUpTicket("Collections", ex));
```

---

_We just saw the core principle of Flow in action:_

-  _The `PaymentCollectionService` defined the business logic._
-  _We, as the consumer, applied the operational logic on top._
-  _The two are completely decoupled._

### Step 3: Executing the Final, Enriched Flow

We've built our final recipe. We've **declared** our Flow/intention/plan of action. 

But NO actions have been taken yet - NOTHING has been executed.

Time to pass the recipe to the chef!

Enter `FlowEngine`. 

```csharp
var result = await FlowEngine.ExecuteAsync(finalNoticeFlow);

var message = result switch
{
    Success<PostalTrackingId> s => $"Notice sent! Tracking ID: {s.Value.Id}",
    Failure<PostalTrackingId> => "Failed to send collection notice after all retries.",
};

Console.WriteLine(message);
```

### üí° Bottom Line 

Flow allows you to build clean and focused business logic.

You then compose operational concerns around it **where they're needed, not where they're defined**. üéØ

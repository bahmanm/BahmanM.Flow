# Introduction: The 'Why'

Is your business logic a tangled mess of `try-catch` blocks and `if-else` statements? Do you find error handling, logging, and retries cluttering your core code?

What if you could refactor that complexity into a clean, chainable sequence of operations instead? A sequence that is a pleasure to express, read, and maintain?

This is the problem that **Flow** is designed to solve.

### The Core Idea: Recipe and Chef

Flow is built on a simple analogy:

-  A **Flow** is a **recipe**; an immutable, declarative blueprint that describes the steps in your process.
-  The **`FlowEngine`** is the **chef**; it takes your recipe and executes it, handling the messy details of `async` operations and exceptions.

This separation of concerns is the key to writing code that is easier to read, test, and reuse.

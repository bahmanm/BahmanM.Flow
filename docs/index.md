## Getting Started

For the best experience, we recommend reading the introductory guides in order.

1.  **[Introduction](./introduction.md)**
    *   Understand the "why" behind Flow and its core "Recipe/Chef" idea.
2.  **[Your First Pipeline](./basic-pipeline.md)**
    *   See a real-world example of refactoring complex code into a clean Flow.
3.  **[Advanced Concepts](./advanced-concepts.md)**
    *   Explore composable behaviours and see a more complex, real-world example.

# Welcome to the Flow Documentation

**Flow** is a lightweight, powerful framework for building robust, predictable, and testable business logic in .NET. It provides a simple, fluent API for composing complex operations, handling failures, and managing cross-cutting concerns in a declarative and immutable way.

This documentation site provides a deeper dive into the concepts and patterns behind the library.
